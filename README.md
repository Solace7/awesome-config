### Greyspace Awesome-WM Configuration Files

Worrons config and redflat utils seem like a good place for me to start making this custom config I have thats more friendly for systems that dont have much freedom when it comes to multi key keybindings. My primary use for this will be on my nokia N900 running postmarketOS. I enjoy the i3 that it comes with. But would like the customizability I'm used to in awesome.
